# probabilistic_numerics
Code and documentation for various probabilistic numerics projects. Each of the following subfolders has its own README with further details.

1) `Laplace_Approximation`: development of a tool to diagnose the quality of a Laplace Approximation based on Bayesian Quadrature. The "main" project, comprising about a third of my Ph.D. thesis
2) `uqdesShaun`: modifications of the code for a [Bayesian differential equation solver](https://github.com/ochkrebtii/uqdes) (Chkrebtii et al. 2016) to allow it to use GPU's and/or sparse matrices.
